**Node.js**



As a forerunner in server-side application management, node.js seemed like the best bet here, to allow me to keep JS across the whole application.



As my first node project, I am learning as I go with this one, but seems as though express will be the framework to use.





**MySQL**



This Relational Database Management System has been recommended, and so far proves to be straight forward to use. First database, so once again learning as I go, but I like the workbench feature that allows the creation of diagrams, tables etc before executing this in the client.



**Vue.js**



Another great JS tool that enables the creation of user interfaces through it.
